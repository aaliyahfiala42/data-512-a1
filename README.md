# Monthly Wikipedia Traffic
## A1: Data Curation Assignment 


## Project Goal
The goal of this assignment is to construct, analyze, and publish a dataset of monthly traffic on English Wikipedia from January 1 2008 through August 30 2021.

## Data Sources
For this project I used two APIs ...

### Wikipedia REST API
Terms of use: https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Wikimedia_REST_API#Terms_and_conditions

## Known Issues
Data from the Pageview API excludes spiders/crawlers, while data from the Pagecounts API does not.
Overlap between APIs in months and inconsitency in counting views
Assumption that both APIs count mobile views the same
